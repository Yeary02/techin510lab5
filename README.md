# Jargon Explainer

The Jargon Explainer App leverages a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) to demystify complex jargon and technical terms, making them easily understandable to a non-specialist audience. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just curious, this tool can help you grasp complex concepts with ease.

## How to Run

To run the app on your local machine, follow these steps:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py
```

## What's Included

- `app.py`: The main Flask application

## Lessons Learned

### API Integration: 
- The integration of the Gemini API within the Python environment was relatively straightforward. Utilizing dotenv for managing API keys proved effective in maintaining the security of sensitive information. This approach can be recommended for similar applications that require external API interactions.
- Streamlit for Prototyping: Using Streamlit to quickly develop a web interface was instrumental. Streamlit's ability to rapidly prototype an interactive application allowed for immediate feedback on the functionality of the app, including the user input process and the display of API-generated content. 
- Template Utilization: The use of a prompt template to standardize requests to the Gemini API helped in maintaining consistent quality in the explanations provided. This method ensured that the AI's responses adhered to the desired simplicity and clarity, emphasizing the importance of carefully designing prompts when working with language models.

## Questions/Uncertainties
- Model Limitations: What are the limitations of the Gemini API in terms of the complexity and scope of jargon it can effectively simplify? Understanding these limitations is critical for setting realistic expectations for end-users.
- API Scalability: How well does the Gemini API scale with increased user load? The application's performance under stress, especially with concurrent users, remains a question, particularly considering the potential for rate limiting by the API.
- Response Time Variability: The response time from the Gemini API appeared to vary based on the complexity of the term provided. This variability could impact user experience, especially in a real-time web application setting. Further investigation is needed to determine average response times and potential optimizations.
